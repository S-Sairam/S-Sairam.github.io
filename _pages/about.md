My work is dedicated to building robust and reliable AI systems from first principles. I believe that true progress in machine learning requires moving beyond "black box" models and towards a deeper, more rigorous understanding of the mechanics that govern them. My approach is grounded in meticulous engineering and the scientific principle of reproducibility.
This philosophy is demonstrated through my work:
Rigorous Replication of State-of-the-Art Research: I conduct deep dives into landmark papers to understand and replicate their findings. My most recent project was a complete, clean-room implementation of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), successfully reproducing the CIFAR-10 results from the original ICLR 2021 paper. This work reinforces my commitment to the scientific validation of complex algorithms.

First-Principles Engineering: I build core machine learning systems from the ground up to gain a mastery of their internal mechanics. I engineered a complete, reverse-mode automatic differentiation engine in Python, which I validated by building and training a neural network using only my custom framework.

Exploration of Foundational Priors: I investigate how principles from other scientific domains can inform the construction of more robust computational systems. This includes a research project on developing a Quantum Random Number Generator based on the Leggett-Garg Inequality for use in post-quantum cryptography.
My current research is focused on leveraging this foundational understanding to tackle the next frontier: the theory and practice of advanced optimization. I am now in the process of developing Artemis, a novel optimizer that aims to unify the geometric insights of methods like SAM with the principled uncertainty of Bayesian inference.
My goal is to be a researcher who does not just use the tools, but builds them, understands them, and improves them.
