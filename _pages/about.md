I am a third-year undergraduate researcher at PES University. My research focuses on Controlled Failure Modes in Deep Learning currently looking at geometric instability in Low-Precision Optimization.

Some of my projects:

*   **The Geometry of Bit-Collapse** Investigating the spectral impact of Quantization. Demonstrated that Int8 quantization induces sharp minima (Bit-Collapse) and that SAM restores geometric robustness.
    *   **[View the Plots](https://github.com/S-Sairam/bit-collapse-geometry)**

*   **First-Principles Engineering:** To master the mechanics of deep learning, I engineered a complete, **reverse-mode automatic differentiation engine** in Python from the ground up. I then built and trained a neural network using only this custom framework, demonstrating a ground-up understanding of gradient-based learning.
