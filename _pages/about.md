My research is dedicated to a single challenge: moving beyond the brittle, correlational paradigms of modern AI to build systems that can reason with causal understanding and verifiable robustness. I believe the next generation of artificial intelligence will not be built on scale alone, but on a principled synthesis of deep learning's perceptual power with the rigorous structures of causality, logic, and probability.

My work is focused on attacking this problem from first principles. I architect and build Causal-NeuroSymbolic frameworks designed to operate under the noisy, uncertain, and contradictory conditions that define real-world problems. My current research involves two primary thrusts:
1. Developing novel architectures, like HyCaNeS, that treat symbolic knowledge not as rigid constraints but as learnable, probabilistic priors, enabling a new level of robustness.
2. Forging new methods for rigorous causal effect estimation on complex, structured data, such as our GraphDML framework for networked systems.
